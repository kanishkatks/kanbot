# Kanbot Portfolio Assistant: Talk to My Experience & Projects 

A smart, conversational assistant built into my portfolio website that answers questions about my background, projects, and skills in natural language. It feels like chatting with me, even when I'm not available!

## What This Project Does

This assistant helps visitors to my website learn more about:
- My work history and projects
- Education and research background  
- Technical skills and expertise
- Detailed information about specific projects

Instead of reading through my entire portfolio, visitors can simply ask questions like "What experience does Kanishka have with machine learning?" or "Tell me about the Movie Recommender project" and get immediate, accurate answers.

## How It Works: Smart Document Search + AI Writing

The assistant combines two powerful technologies:

1. **Smart Document Search**: Finds the most relevant parts of my portfolio based on your question
2. **AI Text Generation**: Creates natural, conversational answers using only the accurate information found

This approach (called "Retrieval-Augmented Generation" or RAG) ensures responses are:
- Accurate and factual
- Based only on my real experience
- Detailed where needed
- Conversational and helpful
